WooCommerce Fosdick Fulfilment
==============================

A WooCommerce Fosdick Fulfilment Payment Gateway

##*Disclaimer*
I have no affiliation with either WooCommerce or Fosdick fulfilment.  This plugin has no guarantees of working although I will try to fix any Bug Reports that are submitted.  This code is based off of WooCommerce's public API and code that I found for Fosdick's api.

This WooCommerce Plugin allows you to use Fosdick Fulfilment as a WooCommerce "Payment Gateway"  It allows you to combine the ease and customization of WooCommerce, with your existing Fosdick account.  All fields can easily be modified from your WooCommerce admin screen.

Developed using WooCommerce 2.1.5, but should work with others.
